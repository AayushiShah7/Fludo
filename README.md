# FluDo - Mobile Application

This app was designed in such a way that a user can launch, delete, start, stop, etc. other services of Docker by using the application. This application was created in a flexible that we can run almost all other RHEL8 commands.

We have used Flutter, Linux (Rhel8), Python CGI (for API). 

You can run docker commands like: docker ps; docker info; docker start `container_name`; docker attach -it `container_name`; etc.
